00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.600
The skin consists of three main layers: the epidermis, the dermis and the hypodermis.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.720
The epidermis is the outer layer of the skin.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.400
It is very thin, about 0.1 mm.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.520
The epidermis mainly consists of keratinocytes.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.520
These are cells that have a protecting role.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.080
The epidermis also contains immune cells such as langerhans cells and T-cells.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:43.280
In the deepest part of the epidermis, melanocytes produce melanin which determines a person's skin tone

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.360
and protects the skin against harmful, ultraviolet radiation. s the skin against harmful, ultraviolet radiation.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.120
The epidermis does not have its own blood supply

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.400
and receives nutrients through diffusion of fluids from the dermis below and oxygen from the surrounding air.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.640
It is firmly connected to the dermis at the dermo-epidermal junction.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.280
The middle skin layer is called the dermis.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.920
The dermis is thicker than the epidermis, around 1-5mm thick.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:33.280
The dermis is made up of connective tissue, mainly containing fibroblasts within a collagen-elastin matrix.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.840
Collagen ensures skin strength and elastin provides elasticity.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.120
Similar to the epidermis, the dermis also contains additional immune cells

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:53.160
such as macrophages, mast cells, dermal dendritic cells and natural killer t-cells (NKT).

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.360
In the dermis, there are also blood and lymph vessels,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.080
nerve endings and sweat glands.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.280
The third skin layer is the hypodermis.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.040
The hypodermis consists of adipocytes, also known as body fat, and loose connective tissue.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.000
It contains nerves and larger blood and lymph vessels compared to those found in the dermis.
