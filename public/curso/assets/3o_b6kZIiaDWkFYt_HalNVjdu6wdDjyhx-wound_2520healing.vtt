00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.840
Wound healing is a complex process that involves the coordinated response

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.200
of various cells to restore tissue integrity and function.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.840
The process can be divided into several overlapping phases:

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.080
hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and maturation.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:30.720
In the hemostasis phase, the body activates its emergency repair system, the blood clotting system.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.160
Blood forms a clot that plugs the damaged blood vessel wall to stop the bleeding

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.400
and builds up a provisional matrix for wound healing.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.120
It is the initial response to an injury within the first few minutes.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.120
The inflammation phase focuses on wound cleansing.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:04.040
White blood cells, mainly neutrophils, enter the wound to destroy bacteria and foreign bodies and remove debris.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:13.680
Further types of white blood cells called macrophages also help to remove debris and facilitate tissue repair.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:22.400
This phase usually lasts 4 to 6 days and is often associated with swelling, heat, pain and redness.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.080
After the inflammation phase, the skin is ready to regenerate, starting with the granulation tissue.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:43.320
The proliferation phase is responsible for building up more granulation tissue, wound contraction and epithelialization.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.440
During granulation, fibroblasts fill the wound bed and build connective tissue.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.320
New blood vessels are formed that supply nutrients to the healing tissue.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.720
Myofibroblasts initiate wound contraction.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.760
During epithelialization, the wound surface is covered by epithelial cells.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:14.280
The newly grown tissue is still very fragile at this stage and can easily be torn open again.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.040
The proliferation phase often lasts 3 to 21 days.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.080
The last phase of the healing process is the maturation phase.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.200
This is where the remodeling begins.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.480
The scar tissue is reorganized to provide optimum tensile strength.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.640
The scar becomes flatter and more flexible.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.920
After complete healing, the tissue regains 80% of its former strength.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.440
The maturation phase can last from 21 days to 2 years.
